aMALgamous is a collection of payloads, shells, and malware generation. As well as a collection of tips and tricks that I have collected over the years of penetration testing.

## Updates
**Upgrade** January 4, 2021: Added the first edition of SSSHHH C2. This C2 uses AWS S3 Buckets to pass commands and read results. I have only built payloads in python for now. I am planning to make it multi victim capable, but I am still working on the C2 interface.


**NOTE** November 11, 2020: I just fixed a bug that would break aMALgamous if there was an interface on the system that didn't have an IPv4 address. Please update your repositories. 

*THANKS*  :sunglasses:

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/Marantral/aMALgamous.git
cd aMALgamous 
sudo ./setup.sh 

You have to make sure that the dpkg --add-architecture i386 worked and you can install x86 packages
```
## Run/Operate
```
python3 aMALgamous.py
```

Place the c2 python file on your control system and the payload file on the target. All traffic will be routed through AWS S3.
You will need to have a few items to make this work.
- An AWS account
- An AWS key and secret (Make sure that the permissions on it only allows for modification of the S3 buckets).
All other settings and configurations will be done by aMALgamous. 

NOTE: When done you will need to manually clean your S3 buckets that were created.


**All malware will be placed in aMALgamatiom/current with old malware being placed in an arcive folder.** <br />
